Covid-19 affects on the Australian tourism industry

Project 1 Group Members: Paul Roberts, Dale Hancke, Jens Weimann

This project looked at how the covid-19 pandemic affected several aspects of the Australian tourism industry. The areas looked at:

•	Short term visitors into Australia

•	Overnight trips within Australia

•	The average number of nights per stay

•	Tourism affiliated jobs

•	The total number of tourism jobs in Australia


The main questions we sought to answer were: 

•	How the states were impacted?

•	How various tourism-related industries impacted?

•	How was the job market impacted here?

•	How is the tourism market recovering?

Conclusions:

•	Short term arrivals into Australia are increasing but probably won’t be back to pre-covid levels before 2024.

•	The overnight trips within Australia were greatly impacted. While Perth is just back to normal levels, Sydney will probably take another 6 months to return to pre-covid levels

•	Looking at jobs data - a comparison of 2018-19 (peak in data from 2015 onwards) to 2021-22, we can see the jobs market in the tourism market were impacted:
  o	Most notably were the industries highlighted in the media : Restaurants and retail, however it was interesting to see that accommodation did not seem to be as severely impacted 
  o	This may be related to the Tourism data previously which saw extended stays (or perhaps a sign of a faster recovery, given the data falls inside the 2022 year when COVID started being less impactful). This may be worthwhile looking into further
  o	Also interesting was that Sports and Rec services showed little variance
  o	Another area of interest is that Travel Agencies and Info Center Services did not seem to be as impacted as what other industries here were, despite what the media seemed to suggest.
