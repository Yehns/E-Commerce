The two main focuses will be on short-term arrivals within Australia and full-time employment data within the tourism industry, and how COVID-19 has impacted the tourism industry.

Starting with the flight data, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) provides data extending from January 2013 to November 2022 for the short-term visitor arrivals into each state of Australia. Short-term visitors refer to overseas travellers entering the term on short stays primarily for vacation purposes. The data has been reformatted for ease of readability on a graph, with adjustments to headings and display of specific states, and is accompanied by trendlines for both pre and post covid travel restrictions within the state of WA. These restrictions are measured before and after April 2020 with summary statistics provided for each new data group measuring key data points for comparison.

When analysing the flight data for conclusions, it remains consistent within each state that short-term arrivals are most prominent from January to March of each year. This is indicated by the sharp peaks in all the data sets, followed by troughs. The trend lines for pre-covid indicate a slight positive growth with an R-value of 0.38 and average monthly visitors of 671,000 with an average monthly growth rate of 0.01%. Following covid restrictions, the sudden drop can be seen in short-term visitor arrivals. Average monthly visitors reduced to 125,000 due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions but is followed by a strong monthly increase during "Post-Covid" of 0.3% and it is expected that flights will reach the previous average within the next 5 to 6 months with current monthly growth rates, indicating a strong, short-term recovery. 

The next selected data set is the total full-time jobs that the tourism industry in Australia provided from 2005 to 2022. This data has also been extracted from ABS data and includes multiple tourism industries in Australia. The data focuses on the total of male and female jobs that the tourism industry in Australia provided. The data reveals that growth has been consistent for the total amount of jobs the tourism industry maintains. The r-value of total jobs is 0.64, indicating a somewhat strong positive growth from 2005 and 2022, regardless of the decrease in employment COVID-19 caused. The graphs indicate a slight increase in both male and female jobs in 2009 with a peak in 2017 and 2018. 

There is a significant decline in the total amount of jobs between 2018 and 2021  and then again an increase in 2022. The strongest year of employment was in 2018 and 2019 yielding a total of 323,000 jobs in Australia. The overall decline of tourism jobs saw a 35% decrease in employment within the covid period, which equates to a loss of 114,000 jobs over 3 years and is rapidly increasing again, with an estimated 39,000 jobs reclaimed since 2022. The data provides a strong indication that female jobs are more prominent than male jobs, but both grow relatively consistently and reflect each other. Annually, from 2005 tourism jobs in Australia have grown consistently at a rate of 0.01% per year, which is equivalent to an average of 25,000 jobs.
