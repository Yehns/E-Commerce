Covid-19 affects on the Australian tourism industry

Project 1 Group Members: Paul Roberts, Dale Hancke, Jens Weimann

This project looked at how the covid-19 pandemic affected several aspects of the Australian tourism industry. The areas looked at:
•	Short term visitors into Australia

•	Overnight trips within Australia

•	The average number of nights per stay

•	Tourism affiliated jobs

•	The total number of tourism jobs in Australia


The main questions we sought to answer were: 

•	How the states were impacted?

•	How various tourism-related industries impacted?

•	How was the job market impacted here?

•	How is the tourism market recovering?

Conclusions:

•	Short term arrivals into Australia are increasing but probably won’t be back to pre-covid levels before 2024.

•	The overnight trips within Australia were greatly impacted. While Perth is just back to normal levels, Sydney will probably take another 6 months to return to pre-covid levels
